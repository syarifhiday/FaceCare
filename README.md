# FaceCare - Acne Detection Application Using Machine Learning

FaceCare is an Android application that uses acne detection technology on the face through machine learning. This technology is implemented on Cloud Run, allowing users to upload photos of their faces and receive a diagnosis on whether they have acne.

The application currently uses a machine learning model that can distinguish between healthy faces and faces with acne. However, the development team hopes to further develop this application to detect various other facial conditions.
